This App could translate Uyghur language to International Phonetic Alphabet.
In Xinjiang,China, college students who learning Uyghur language have trouble to translate to International Phonetic Alphabet in academic paper.
So I design this application for them, to help them increase their efficiency.
Now, as I know it helps more than 20 college students to write their academic paper.
